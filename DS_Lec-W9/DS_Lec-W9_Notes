Simple Linear Regression vs Multiple Linear Regression
One independent and one dependent but multiple have multiple dependencies between the relations
y = mx + c, y depends on x but m and c are the coefficients

Training you need to feed the independant and dependant variables to the model
Testing is for the model to eveluate the dependent variable from independent values

1.Define The X and Y
2.Do Data Frame
3.Divide Observation to Training and Testing
4.Make the Model

Slopes of the Linear Graph (aka Gradient)

Error Rate: (Actual Value - Predicted Value) / Actual * 100%
