1. Strength of Correlation

0.00 - 0.19 = Very Weak
0.20 - 0.39 = Weak
0.40 - 0.59 = Moderate
0.60 - 0.79 = Strong
0.80 - 1.00 = Very Strong

2. Direction
+ve -> var1 increase, var2 increase
-ve -> var1 increase, var2 decrease

Pearson Correlation
The value of correlation will explain the direction

Correllogram
The size of the circle is the strength while the colour is the direction

Heatmap
The cell values will show the strength while the - or + is the direction

Melt Function will reshape it into an acceptable format into one observation per row with variables with their corresponding value
