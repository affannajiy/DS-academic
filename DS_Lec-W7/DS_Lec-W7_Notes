Imbalance Data
Def: Types of datasets that has a target class that has an uneven distribution of observations
One label is too high observations and some as too low observations
Ex: 100 observations, 95 says Yes, 5 says No

Methods to Handle
1. Oversampling (when dataset is small): replicates observations from minority to balance data
2. Undersampling (when dataset is large): reduce number of observation from majority to balance data

#Scaling Data
Def: Handle varying values or units

Method:
1. Normalisation
When features are different scales

2. Standardisation
